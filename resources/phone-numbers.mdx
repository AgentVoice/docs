## Accessing the Numbers Section

Navigate to the left side of your screen and click on the **Numbers** tab.

The Numbers interface displays all your current phone numbers and provides tools to search and manage them. Use the search bar to search for specific phone numbers if you have multiple numbers.

## Getting a New Phone Number

Click either the **Get a Number** button or the **New Number** button in the toolbar.

Enter the desired area code in the search field and click **View Available Numbers**. Browse the available numbers and select the one you want to use.

Before completing your purchase, select which agent will answer calls to this number from the dropdown menu. You must assign the number to an agent; you cannot have an unassigned phone number.

Review the details and click **Confirm Purchase** to activate the number.

Note: Depending on your plan, additional phone numbers may incur extra charges.

## Testing Your New Phone Number

Once you've acquired a phone number, use your mobile phone or another device to call the newly acquired number. Your assigned agent should answer the call. Interact with your agent to ensure everything is working correctly.

## Managing Existing Phone Numbers

**Changing the Assigned Agent**: Locate the phone number in your list, click on the current agent name or the edit icon, select a different agent from the dropdown menu, and save your changes.

**Deleting a Phone Number**: Find the phone number you want to delete, click the **Delete** button associated with that number, and confirm the deletion when prompted.

Note: Deleting a phone number will make it unavailable for future use with your account. If you think you might need it later, consider reassigning it instead of deleting it.

## Plan Limitations

The number of phone numbers you can have depends on your AgentVoice subscription plan. Different plans allow for different numbers of phone numbers. For example, the Business plan allows up to three phone numbers per organization.

If you need additional phone numbers beyond your plan's limit, you may need to upgrade your subscription.
