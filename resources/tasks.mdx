## Accessing the Tasks Section

Navigate to the **Agents** tab, select the agent you want to manage, hover over **Schedules** in the agent profile navigation bar, and click on **Tasks**.

The Tasks section shows tasks for the specific agent you've selected, while the main Calendar section (under Activity) shows tasks for all agents in your organization. Both interfaces offer similar functionality but with different scope.

## Task Interface

The Tasks interface provides several ways to view and manage your agent's tasks.

Choose a time period (Day, Week, or All) to determine how many tasks to display. You can also select a specific date to view tasks for that day.

Use the search bar to find specific tasks by title, notes, or contact information. Sort tasks by time, status, or type. Filter by status (Scheduled, Completed, or Failed).

## Creating New Tasks

Click the **\+** button next to the expand window to create a new task.

**Task Details**:

* **Task Title**: A name for your reference (not visible to the agent)  
* **Task Type**: Choose from call, text, email, or API  
* **Task Purpose**: Select from follow-up, notify, remind, send info, or update info

**Contact Information**:

* **Select Contact**: Choose an existing contact or create a new one  
* **Time Zone**: Select the appropriate time zone (defaults to your current time zone)

**Scheduling**:

* **Date**: Choose when the task should run  
* **Time**: Set the specific time for execution

**Agent Selection**: Choose which agent should perform the task (defaults to the currently selected agent).

**Task Instructions**: Optionally provide specific instructions for your agent about how to handle this particular task.

## Managing Tasks

Click the **Expand** button to open a detailed modal that shows all tasks on the left side and detailed information about the selected task on the right side.

When viewing a task, you can see all basic information (type, contact, scheduled time), current status (scheduled, completed, failed), transcripts of calls (for completed call tasks), content of texts or emails (for completed text/email tasks), and API response details (for completed API tasks).

Tasks may fail for various reasons such as invalid contact information, connection issues, or API failures. Filter by status to identify failed tasks, review the error details, fix the issue, and reschedule if necessary.

With proper configuration, your agents can create tasks for themselves based on conversations or predetermined workflows. These self-created tasks will appear in the same interface.
