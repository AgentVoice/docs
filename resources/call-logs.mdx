## Accessing the Calls Page

Click on the **Calls** tab in the main navigation menu to display a list of all calls handled by your agents.

## Calls Interface

The Calls page displays a comprehensive list of all calls with the following information:

* **Status**: Shows how the call ended (e.g., "Agent has ended the call")  
* **Status Indicator**: A colored indicator (green for successful calls, other colors for different outcomes)  
* **From Number**: The phone number that initiated the call (for inbound calls: the customer's phone number; for outbound calls: your agent's phone number; for web calls: may not show a phone number)  
* **To Number**: The receiving phone number  
* **Type**: Web (browser-based test calls), Inbound (calls received by your agent), or Outbound (calls made by your agent)  
* **Duration**: How long the call lasted

## Viewing Call Details

Click anywhere on the call's row in the list, or click the information icon (i) on the right side of the row.

The call details view provides date and time (the exact date and time when the call took place), call participants (complete information about who was on the call), call recording (an audio recording of the entire conversation), and call transcript (a text transcript of everything said during the call).

To listen to a call recording, open the call details view, click the play button on the audio player, and you can follow along with the transcript as the audio plays.

## Customizing the End Call Message

By default, your agent will say "Goodbye" when ending a call, but you can customize this message.

Go to the **Agents** tab, select the agent you want to modify, click on **Tools** in the agent profile, find and click on **End Call**, update the message in the description field, and click **Save** to apply your changes.

## Using Call Logs for Quality Assurance

Regularly review call recordings and transcripts to ensure your agent is handling interactions appropriately. Identify common questions or issues that may require updates to your agent's configuration. Track call durations to understand how efficiently your agent is resolving inquiries. Verify that your agent is properly following scripts and using the correct end call message.
