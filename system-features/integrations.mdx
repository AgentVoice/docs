## CRM Connections

Bidirectional sync with your CRM keeps data consistent everywhere.

The platform includes a CRM webhook endpoint that receives contact data from external CRM systems and creates or updates contacts accordingly.

The webhook accepts a POST request with a source identifier (like "salesforce" or "hubspot") and contact data including crm\_id (required), first\_name, last\_name, email, phone, and company.

The system supports various field naming conventions from different CRM systems, automatically mapping firstName/first\_name/name and similar variations.
