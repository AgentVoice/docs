## Contact Memory

Your agent can remember previous conversations. This memory eliminates the frustration of customers having to repeat themselves and enables increasingly effective interactions over time.

The agent remembers conversation history (complete record of all interactions, topics discussed, questions asked and answered, decisions made), expressed preferences (communication preferences, best times to contact, language preferences, tone preferences), previous issues and resolutions (problems reported, solutions provided, satisfaction with resolution), and relationship context (how long they've been a customer, products or services used, referral source).

Memory syncs with your CRM, updating fields after each call, logging interactions automatically, and populating custom fields.

Your agent remembers what it has done, preventing duplicate actions and redundant questions. This includes appointments scheduled, payments processed, documents sent, tickets created, and information provided.

## Knowledge Sources

Equip agents with your organization's knowledge from multiple sources that stay current.

Create a knowledge base by navigating to **Knowledge Base** in the left sidebar and clicking **Create Knowledge Base**. Provide a name and description, then add content:

**Websites**: Enter up to 10 URLs. The AI extracts relevant content and can update automatically on schedule.

**Documents**: Upload PDF, Word (DOCX), or TXT files. Up to 10 documents per knowledge base. Processes structured content like manuals, guides, and policies.

**Audio Files**: Upload MP3, WAV, or M4A formats. Up to 10 audio files. Extracts information from recordings.

**Images**: Upload charts, graphs, or infographics. Up to 10 images. Converts visual information to usable knowledge.

When you add content, the AI analyzes each source (30-60 seconds per item), extracts key information, identifies topics and themes, generates summaries, creates a searchable index, and optimizes for retrieval.

After adding and reviewing content, click **Approve and Create**. To attach to an agent, go to your agent's page, navigate to **Agent Setup**, scroll to the **Knowledge** section, click **Select Knowledge Base**, choose your knowledge base, and click **Save**.

Test your knowledge base by clicking **Start Test** in the agent's page and asking questions related to your knowledge base content.

## Context Retrieval

Intelligent retrieval ensures agents access the right information at the right moment without hallucinating or providing outdated answers.

The system uses semantic search that understands meaning, not just keyword matching. It finds information even with different phrasing, understands synonyms and related concepts, and handles questions in natural language.

Rather than feeding entire documents to the agent, the system extracts only relevant sections, maintains focus on the question, reduces processing time, and improves response accuracy.

When information exists in multiple sources, the system synthesizes across sources, identifies most current information, notes when sources agree or conflict, and prioritizes by relevance and recency.

The agent explains sources when appropriate: "According to our refund policy document..." or "Based on the current pricing on our website..."

The agent knows its limitations and acknowledges when information isn't in the knowledge base. It doesn't fabricate information and offers to escalate or follow up when needed.
