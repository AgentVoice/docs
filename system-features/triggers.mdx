### What Are Triggers?

Triggers are automation rules that run actions automatically when something happens in your account. Think of them as "If this happens, then do that" rules.

For example:

- **When** a new contact is created → **Automatically** add them to your welcome campaign
- **When** you tag a contact as "hot lead" → **Automatically** schedule a follow-up call
- **When** a call ends → **Automatically** add them to your nurture sequence

No more manual work. Set it once, and it runs forever.

## How to Create a Trigger

### Step 1: Choose Your Event

Pick what event will start the automation:

- **Contact Created** - When you add a new contact
- **Contact Called** - When a contact receives a call
- **Tag Added** - When you add a tag to a contact
- **Tag Removed** - When you remove a tag
- **Variable Changed** - When contact information updates

**More events coming soon!** We're constantly adding new trigger events based on your feedback.

### Step 2: Add Conditions (Optional)

You can add filters to be more specific about when the trigger runs.

Examples:

- Only run for contacts from "Acme Corp"
- Only run for contacts tagged "VIP"
- Only run for contacts with phone numbers

**More conditions coming soon!** Advanced filtering options will be added over time.

### Step 3: Choose Your Actions

Pick what should happen automatically:

**Call Actions:**

- **Call Immediately** - Start a call right away with your chosen agent
- **Schedule Call** - Schedule a call for later (you pick the delay)

**Campaign Actions:**

- **Add to Campaign** - Automatically enroll contacts into a campaign
- **Remove from Campaign** - Take contacts out of a campaign

**More actions coming soon!** We're adding new actions like sending emails, SMS, webhooks, and more.

You can add multiple actions to one trigger!

### Step 4: Enable It

Turn it on and it runs automatically in the background.

## Real Examples

### Example 1: Welcome New Contacts

**When:** New contact is created\
**Action:** Add them to "Welcome Campaign"

Now every new contact automatically gets added to your welcome sequence. Zero manual work.

---

### Example 2: Fast Follow-Up on Hot Leads

**When:** You add the tag "hot-lead" to a contact\
**Action:** Schedule a call in 5 minutes

You tag someone as a hot lead, and your system automatically queues up a quick follow-up call.

---

### Example 3: Multi-Step Workflow

**When:** New contact is created\
**Actions:**

1. Add to "Nurture Campaign"
2. Schedule a call in 1 hour

One trigger, multiple actions. Your entire workflow runs on autopilot.

## Managing Your Triggers

### View All Triggers

See all your automation rules in one place. Check which ones are active and which are paused.

### See What's Running

Every time a trigger fires, we log it. You can see:

- How many times it's run
- Success rate
- Any errors or skipped actions
- When it last ran

### Turn Triggers On/Off

Need to pause an automation? Just toggle it off. Turn it back on whenever you're ready.

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I create a campaign with 0 contacts and let triggers populate it?**\
Yes! This is actually perfect for automation. Create an empty campaign, then set up triggers to add contacts automatically.

**Q: What if a trigger fails?**\
We log every execution. If something fails, you'll see exactly what happened and can fix it.

**Q: Can I have multiple triggers for the same event?**\
Absolutely! You might have one trigger that adds all new contacts to Campaign A, and another that adds only VIP contacts to Campaign B.

**Q: Do triggers work retroactively?**\
No. Triggers only run for events that happen _after_ you create them. They don't go back in time.

**Q: Will new features cost extra?**\
Nope! All trigger features are included in your plan as we add them.

## Getting Started

1. Go to **Triggers** in your dashboard
2. Click **Create Trigger**
3. **Choose your event** (like "Contact Created")
4. **Add conditions** (optional filters - skip if you want it to run for everyone)
5. **Choose your actions** (like "Add to Campaign")
6. **Name it and review** your workflow
7. Click **Save** and turn it on

That's it! Your automation is now running 24/7.

**Pro Tip:** Start simple with one trigger, test it, then build more complex workflows once you're comfortable.

That's it! Your automation is now running 24/7.
