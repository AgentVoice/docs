## Create Your First Agent

To create a new agent, click the **Create Agent** button on your dashboard or the **New Agent** button in the agents section. You'll be taken to the Create New Agent page.

**Agent Name**

* For your internal record-keeping only  
* The AI will not see this name  
* Use descriptive names like "Customer Support" or "Legal Intake"  
* Essential when managing multiple agents

**Introduction Script**

* What the agent says when answering inbound calls  
* Keep it concise due to character limits  
* For outbound calls, introductions can be configured separately and made dynamic

**Agent Instructions**

Tell the agent who it is and how it should behave. Think of this as writing a job description:

* Name (what it should call itself)  
* Role and capabilities  
* Tasks it can perform  
* How it should reason and make decisions  
* Tone and communication style

There is a character limit initially, but you can add more detailed instructions after creation.

**Voice Selection**

Choose from a variety of voices in different languages. Currently supports English and Spanish with more languages coming soon. Blue stars indicate advanced voices with emotional intelligence that can change tone and pitch based on the situation.

Note: Advanced voices cannot access knowledge bases yet (this feature is coming).

Once you've filled out these fields, scroll to the bottom and click **Create Agent**.

## Get a Phone Number

Navigate to the **Numbers** tab, click **Get a Number** or **New Number**, enter your desired area code, and click **View Available Numbers**. Select a phone number, assign it to your newly created agent, and click **Confirm Purchase**.

Note: Depending on your plan, additional phone numbers may incur extra charges.

## Make Your First Test Call

Navigate to the **Agents** tab, select your agent, and click **Start Test** to initiate a browser-based test call. Have a conversation with your agent, then end the call by asking the agent to hang up or closing the test window.

Alternatively, use your mobile phone to call the phone number you just purchased.

## Review the Call

Click on the **Calls** tab in the main navigation, find your recent test call, and click on it to view the full transcript and audio recording. Review how your agent performed and identify areas for improvement.
