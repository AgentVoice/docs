## Basic Agent Information
### Agent Name
- This is for your internal record-keeping only
- The AI will not see this name
- Use descriptive names (e.g., "Customer Support" or "Sales Agent") to easily identify them later
- This helps when managing multiple agents
### Introduction Script
- This is what the agent will say when someone calls it (inbound calls only)
- Keep it concise as there is a character limit
- For outbound calls, the introduction can be configured separately and made dynamic
## Agent Instructions
- Tell the agent who it is and how it should behave
- Think of this as writing a job description
- Be specific about the agent's: Name (what it should call itself)
- Role and capabilities
- Tasks it can perform
- How it should reason and make decisions
There is a character limit, but you can add more detailed instructions after creation
## Voice Selection
- Choose from a variety of voices in different languages
- Currently supports English and Spanish with more languages coming soon
- Blue stars indicate advanced voices with emotional intelligence: These voices can change tone and pitch based on situation
- Note: These advanced voices cannot access knowledge bases yet
## Completing Creation
Once you've filled out these basic fields:
1. Scroll to the bottom of the page
2. Click the "Create Agent" button
3. You'll be directed to the agent configuration page where you can: Further customize your agent
4. Add knowledge bases
5. Configure additional settings
