title: Your First Agent

## Configuring Agent Personality

Beyond basic instructions, fine-tune how your agent behaves. Determine whether your agent should be formal and professional, friendly and casual, or technical and precise. Configure whether your agent gives concise answers or more detailed explanations, and how proactively it should ask clarifying questions.

## Adding Knowledge Sources

Equip your agent with information it needs to answer questions.

Navigate to **Knowledge Base** in the left sidebar and click **Create Knowledge Base**. Provide a name and description for your reference, then add content through multiple sources:

* **Websites**: Up to 10 URLs (the AI extracts relevant information)  
* **Documents**: PDFs, Word files, or TXT files (up to 10\)  
* **Audio Files**: MP3, WAV, or M4A recordings (up to 10\)  
* **Images**: Charts, graphs, or visual information (up to 10\)

The AI processes each source (typically 30-60 seconds per item) and provides analysis showing topics, summaries, and keywords. Review the analysis and click **Approve and Create**.

Total capacity: Up to 40 items across all types per knowledge base.

To attach the knowledge base to your agent, go to your agent's page, navigate to **Agent Setup**, scroll to the **Knowledge** section, click **Select Knowledge Base**, choose your created knowledge base, and click **Save**.

## Setting Up Basic Actions

Actions allow your agent to interact with external systems. Start with the built-in end call action.

Go to **Tools** in the agent profile, find and click **End Call**, update the message in the description field (default is "Goodbye"), and click **Save**.

For creating custom actions that connect to external systems, see the Actions section of this documentation.

## Testing Your Agent

**Browser Testing**: Click **Start Test** in your agent's page. Ask questions related to your knowledge base content, test different conversation paths and edge cases, and verify the agent provides accurate responses.

**Phone Testing**: Call your agent's phone number from your mobile device. Interact as a real customer would. Try interrupting, asking unclear questions, or going off-topic to assess how naturally the conversation flows.

**Review Call Logs**: Navigate to the **Calls** tab and review transcripts and recordings of your test calls. Listen to audio playback while following along with transcripts. Identify areas where responses could be improved and refine agent instructions and knowledge base accordingly.

## Going Live

Once testing shows your agent performs well, update your agent's introduction to be production-ready, configure any necessary scripts for specific conversation flows, set up actions to update your CRM or trigger external workflows, and share your agent's phone number with customers. Monitor initial real-world interactions closely.
