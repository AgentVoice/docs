## Introduction to Phone Numbers
Phone Numbers in AgentVoice allow your AI agents to receive and make calls from and to customers. Each phone number can be assigned to a specific agent, enabling voice communication between your customers and your Agent.

Note: Depending on your plan, additional phone numbers may incur extra charges. Check your current plan details for specific pricing.
## Testing Your New Phone Number

## Managing Existing Phone Numbers
You can manage your existing phone numbers in several ways:

### Deleting a Phone Number
To remove a phone number from your account:

2. Click the **Delete** button associated with that number
3. Confirm the deletion when prompted
Note: Deleting a phone number will make it unavailable for future use with your account. If you think you might need it later, consider reassigning it instead of deleting it.
## Plan Limitations
The number of phone numbers you can have depends on your AgentVoice subscription plan:
- Different plans allow for different numbers of phone numbers
- For example, the Business plan (middle tier) allows up to three phone numbers per organization
If you need additional phone numbers beyond your plan's limit, you may need to upgrade your subscription.
