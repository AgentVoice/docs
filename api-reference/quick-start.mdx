title: Quick Start
description: Get integrated in minutes with the REST API. All requests require authentication using your API key and organization ID.
---

Before using the API, you need an active paid subscription to AgentVoice, at least one agent created on the platform, your Organization ID, an API key, and contacts in your system.

**Generate an API Key**: Go to the Settings page, select the "API Keys" tab, click "Create New API Key", give your key a descriptive name, and copy and securely store your new API key.

**Locate Your Organization ID**: Go to the Settings page and find the "Organization" tab in the top right of the header. Copy your Organization ID.

Agents can only be created and configured through the platform interface, not via the API.
