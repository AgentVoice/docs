## Introduction to Tasks
The Tasks feature in AgentVoice allows you to create, manage, and monitor activities that your AI agents need to perform. Tasks can include calls, texts, emails, or API actions that your agents will execute at scheduled times.

## Accessing the Tasks Section
To access the Tasks section for a specific agent:
1. Navigate to the **Agents** tab
2. Select the agent you want to manage
3. In the agent profile navigation bar, hover over **Schedules**
4. Click on **Tasks**
### Tasks vs. Calendar View
The Tasks section shows tasks for the specific agent you've selected, while the main Calendar section (under Activity) shows tasks for all agents in your organization. Both interfaces offer similar functionality but with different scope:
- Tasks : Agent-specific view focused on task management
- Calendar : Organization-wide view with calendar visualization
## Task Interface Overview
The Tasks interface provides several ways to view and manage your agent's tasks:
### Time Period Selection
Choose how many tasks to display by selecting a time period:
- Day : View tasks for a single day
- Week : View tasks for the current week
- All : View all tasks the agent has ever performed
You can also select a specific date to view tasks for that day.
### Search and Filter
Search for specific tasks using the search bar, which can find matches in:
- Task titles
- Task notes
- Contact information
### Sorting Options
Sort your tasks by different criteria:
- Time : When tasks are scheduled to run
- Status : Whether tasks are scheduled, completed, or failed
- Type : The kind of task (call, text, email, API)
### Status Filtering
Filter tasks based on their current status:
- Scheduled : Tasks that are planned but haven't run yet
- Completed : Tasks that have been successfully executed
- Failed : Tasks that encountered issues and couldn't be completed
## Creating New Tasks
To create a new task for your agent:
1. Click the **+** button next to the expand window
2. In the task creation window, fill in the following details:
### Task Details
- Task Title : A name for your reference (not visible to the agent)
- Task Type : Choose from call, text, email, or API
- Task Purpose : Select from follow-up, notify, remind, send info, or update info
### Contact Information
- Select Contact : Choose an existing contact or create a new one
- Time Zone : Select the appropriate time zone (defaults to your current time zone)
### Scheduling
- Date : Choose when the task should run
- Time : Set the specific time for execution
### Agent Selection
Choose which agent should perform the task (defaults to the currently selected agent).
### Task Instructions
Optionally provide specific instructions for your agent about how to handle this particular task.
## Managing Tasks
Once you've created tasks, you can manage them in several ways:
### Expanded View
Click the **Expand** button to open a detailed modal that shows:
- All tasks listed on the left side
- Detailed information about the selected task on the right side
### Task Details
When viewing a task, you can see:
- All basic information (type, contact, scheduled time)
- Current status (scheduled, completed, failed)
- Transcripts of calls (for completed call tasks)
- Content of texts or emails (for completed text/email tasks)
- API response details (for completed API tasks)
### Managing Failed Tasks
Tasks may fail for various reasons, such as:
- Invalid contact information
- Connection issues
- API failures
You can identify failed tasks by filtering by status, review the error details, fix the issue, and reschedule if necessary.
## Automated Task Creation
With proper configuration, your agents can create tasks for themselves based on conversations or predetermined workflows. These self-created tasks will appear in the same interface, allowing you to monitor and manage them alongside manually created tasks.
