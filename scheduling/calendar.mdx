You can select the contact's time zone:

2. Set the specific time for the task
The system will display a confirmation showing when the task will execute in your local time.

### Task Instructions
Optionally, provide specific instructions for your agent:
- Use this field to include details about what the agent should discuss or address during the interaction
- You can leave this blank if your agent is already configured with a specific process to follow
Once you've filled in all the required information, click **Create Task** to schedule it.
