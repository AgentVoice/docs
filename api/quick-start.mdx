# Getting Started with the AgentVoice API
## Prerequisites
Before you can begin using the AgentVoice API, you'll need:
- An active paid subscription to AgentVoice
- At least one agent created on the platform
- Your Organization ID
- An API key
- Contacts in your system (for making calls)
## Setup Process
### Step 1: Create and Test Your Agent
Before using the API, you must first create your agent through the AgentVoice platform.
1. Log in to your AgentVoice account
2. Navigate to the Agents section
3. Create a new agent with appropriate voice settings and instructions
4. Test your agent thoroughly to ensure it performs as expected
5. Make note of your agent's ID for API calls
**Note:** Agents can only be created and configured through the platform interface, not via the API.
### Step 2: Generate an API Key
You'll need an API key to authenticate your requests:
1. In the AgentVoice platform, go to the Settings page
2. Select the "API Keys" tab
3. Click "Create New API Key"
4. Give your key a descriptive name
5. Copy and securely store your new API key
**Important:** Your API key grants access to your account's resources. Never share it publicly or include it in client-side code.
### Step 3: Locate Your Organization ID
When you create an account, an organization is automatically created for you:
1. Go to the Settings page in the AgentVoice platform
2. Find the "Organization" tab in the top right of the header
3. Copy your Organization ID
### Step 4: Understand Contact Management
To make calls or perform other actions via the API, you'll need contact information:
- Each contact in the system has a unique contact_id
- If you've integrated with a CRM, contacts will also have a crm_id field that links to the corresponding contact in your CRM
- You can use either ID in your API calls, depending on your use case
## What You Can Do With the API
Once your setup is complete, you can use the AgentVoice API to:
- Initiate calls between your agents and contacts
- Update contact information
- Create tasks for your agents
- Retrieve information from the platform to update your systems
- Integrate with your existing CRM and workflow tools
## Next Steps
With your setup complete, you're ready to make your first API call. Refer to our [API Documentation](#api-docs) for detailed endpoint information and examples, starting with the Call Initiation endpoint.
