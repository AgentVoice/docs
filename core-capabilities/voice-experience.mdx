## Natural Conversations

AgentVoice uses advanced voice models that handle interruptions, background noise, and natural speech patterns without breaking flow. Your agents maintain appropriate pace and tone, using verbal acknowledgments like "mm-hmm" or "I understand" just as humans do. They manage smooth turn-taking that feels completely natural.

Unlike rigid IVR systems, these agents adapt to how people actually talk. They handle corrections ("actually, I meant Tuesday, not Thursday"), tangents that provide useful context, and unclear responses that need clarification. The conversation feels natural rather than robotic.

## Voice Selection

Choose from a premium voice library with options across different ages, accents, and speaking styles. Each voice is optimized for low-latency streaming and natural prosody that sounds genuinely human.

Test voices with your actual content, not generic samples. Match voice characteristics to your brand and audience. For legal intake, consider a professional voice with measured pace. For university admissions, a friendly and energetic voice works well. For IT support, a patient and clear technical voice is appropriate.

## Dynamic Greetings

Greetings adapt based on who's calling and why, transforming every call from generic to personal. Recognize returning callers by name and reference previous conversations. Acknowledge the caller's intent before they have to explain themselves. Set the right tone from the first second.

Configure greeting rules based on phone number, time of day, campaign source, or custom parameters pulled from your CRM.

Example for returning customer: "Hi Jennifer, calling back about your consultation request."

Example for first-time caller: "Thanks for calling Acme Legal. I'm Sarah, and I'm here to help you get started with a free consultation."

## Turn Taking & Latency

The streaming architecture delivers sub-second response times while maintaining natural conversation flow. The system handles interruptions gracefully (just like humans do), manages silence detection to know when someone is truly done speaking versus just pausing, and optimizes for different network conditions automatically.

Configure sensitivity settings for different conversation styles. Higher sensitivity works for fast-paced sales calls. More patience is appropriate for support calls where people need time to find information or answer questions carefully.
