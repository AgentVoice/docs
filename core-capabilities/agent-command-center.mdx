## Commanding Your Agent

Direct communication with your agents enables immediate actions and custom instructions for one-off situations.

## Notification Rules

Configure intelligent alert thresholds to stay informed without constant monitoring. Set alerts for high-value contact interactions, specific keywords or phrases, sentiment shifts during conversations, or workflow milestones reached.

## Two-Way Communication

Your agent can proactively communicate when it matters, providing confirmations, summaries, escalations, and approval requests as configured.
